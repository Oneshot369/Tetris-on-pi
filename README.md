# Tetris-on-pie
## Overview
This is my first project using a rasberry pie and python so I wanted to do something relatively easy because I am new to both. 

Right now I am using the emulator of a sense hat, but if you would like to use this project on a real one its very easy to do. 
- First download the code 
- Then open up the tetris.py file in any editor you want
- Now all you have to do is switch: 
``` python
#this imports us a SenseHat object
from sense_emu import SenseHat
```
- To
``` python
#this imports us a SenseHat object
from sense_hat impoty SenseHat
```
Now the code will run on the physical SenseHat
